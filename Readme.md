# Maple is a Good boi (*≧▽≦*)

This repository contains my build of the Maple project — custom firmware, electronics, and modifications for the robot.

## Credits

This project uses the STL files and the core idea from dorianborian's "sesame-robot" project: https://github.com/dorianborian/sesame-robot

I am using the STL files and the high-level concept only. The firmware, electronics, code, and any additional design or modifications in this repository are my own original work.

If you use or adapt assets from the original project, please follow the original project's license and attribute the author accordingly.
